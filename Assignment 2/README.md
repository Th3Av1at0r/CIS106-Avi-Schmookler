I selected Python 3 (Python) as my language, I have used it a bit before this so I have a small understanding of how it works. I intend to extend my knowledge on it and use it in a future job as a Data Scientist. I want to use it as well to make an easy to use D&D program for actions and such. I tried out GDB and Thonny but I think I am going to use GDB because it seems a bit more user friendly and it likes copy paste a bit more.
