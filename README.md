# CIS106-Avi-Schmookler

## Assignment 1

Hello World, My name is Avi Schmookler, I have joined the Cis 106 class because my goal is to either be in the data science field or the video game programming field. I used to program in Python frequently and I have taken a class on Swift. However, I have forgotten everything I did back then, ergo, I need to remind myself of how to code. I know the basics such as how to code in logic and I know some names and techniques for coding. I also am very good with math and thinking logically about problems. I am very excited about this class.

## Assignment 2

I selected Python 3 (Python) as my language, I have used it a bit before this so I have a small understanding of how it works. I intend to extend my knowledge on it and use it in a future job as a Data Scientist. I want to use it as well, to make an easy-to-use D&D program for actions and such. I plan on doing that later tonight. I tried out GDB and Thonny but I think I am going to use GDB because it seems a bit more user-friendly and it likes copy paste a bit more.

## Assignment 3

To be honest I didn't learn much if anything from this assignment considering the fact that I have gone far ahead on Flowgorithm so that I could create my code for personal use. However, the concept of this project is very useful because it teaches about inputs and how to use what one inputs in different ways. The project that I did, project 2, I felt was a very fun, simple project. I also did Activity 1 because it seemed useful. I plan on using this to allow inputs while editing information for Data Science projects to show possibilities of outcomes. This project was a very good introduction to the next week.

## Assignment 4

This assignment was extremely fun to do, I finally got to start to code again and it felt amazing being able to type out simple code again. This feeling is my favorite thing in the world. I did activities 3 and four for assignment 4 it was pretty simple to do and didn't take much time, however, the import of pi was slightly confusing considering that google wanted me to use the term insert so it was a bit confusing. I was able to use Flowgorithm to remember the basics of print and insert and such, however, while doing activity 4 I didn't use it much if at all.

## Assignment 5

This assignment was interesting, it felt as if I was doing earlier projects, the activities weren't super challenging, I did activities five and seven, five was the one where I had to make a program where it calculates the area of a room where the length and the width are given as inputs. The second activity that I did, activity seven, required me to create a program where I asked for the name of the user's dog and ask the age of the user's dog. My program then multiplies the age of the user's dog by seven and then gives the age of the user's dog in dog years. It was an interesting project.

## Assignment 6

This assignment was very fun and interesting, we needed to do two of the older activities. I chose activities four and one. For activity one I had to again make a program where I asked for the rate of someone's pay and the hours they were working per week and it produced the person's pay before taxes in weeks months and years. Activity four was the one where I had to take the length and width and give the area for two different shapes. I chose the triangle and parallelogram again because it seemed easy. I have finally been able to code a program without looking at Flowgorithm. I can use these skills in the future because the formatting is very important for being able to find out where your problems are in a code.

## Assignment 7

In this assignment, I had to use if-else statements while using functions. I made two programs, one where I took the age of the user and transferred it into months days hours, or seconds depending on what the user wanted and the other one I did took the hours and rate of the user's job and calculates the pay while accounting for overtime. I made the first code foolproof with the help of one of my friends, Dillon, who taught me a bit more about tuples. I used them along with while statements to make the program idiot-proof. I can use this to make future projects idiot-proof, it was very helpful.

## Assignment 8

In this assignment, I had to use while statements while using functions. I created two programs, one where I took the grades of a class with a number of students that could be input into the program and gave the class average in an output. for the second one, I took a value and the number of expressions and output the number of expressions using the value, for example, three expressions using the value one are 1 * 1 = 1, 1 * 2 = 2, and 1 * 3 = 3. my cousin in law helped me figure out my troubles using floats and strs and I was able to finish in just under three hours. I will be able to use while statements to create lists in the future.

## Assignment 9

In this assignment, I had to use do-while statements while using functions. I created two programs, the first one I made took grades of a class and continues to add the grades together until a negative number is given. after a negative number is given, the program calculates the average score for the class and presents it. The second program that I created was a guessing game, the user would think of a number between one and one hundred and the program would use Higher and lower values to guess the user's number. I can use the do-while statements in the future to continue translating a paper until it hits the end of the paper.

## Assignment 10

In this assignment I had to use nested loops while using functions, I created one program and edited another. For the one I edited I changed my previous activity 2 to have a statement where if the input wasn't "h", "l", or "e" the program would state that it is an invalid input. For the program that I created, I had to make a program that took the input of the start and finish of where to have a multiplication table start and end. The techniques that I used will be helpful in the future with ranges of numbers that can be associated with variables being able to help me with heavier calculations.

## Assignment 11

In this assignment I had to create two programs using arrays, I created one program that took the grades of students, put them into an array, then found the highest grade, the lowest grade, and the average of all of the grades from the one array. The other program that I created took the user's input of a month and a year and calculated the number of days in that month, and it calculated for leap years in where February has twenty-nine days instead of the usual twenty-eight. Arrays will be helpful in the future when creating lists that I need to use together.

## Assignment 12

In this assignment I had to create two programs using arrays, I created one program that took the grades of students, put them into an array, then found the highest grade, the lowest grade, and the average of all of the grades from the one array. The second program that I created was a guessing game, the user would think of a number between one and one hundred and the program would use Higher and lower values to guess the user's number. I was able to do this quickly because I accidentally did the first code last week. I can use functions such as append and len a lot when needing to create new lists and find information from them. 

## Assignment 13

In this assignment I had to create two programs that edited arrays throughout them, I created one program where I took the first and last name of the user and formatted it in "Lastname, first initial." The second program I created took any list separated by commas and spaces and turned it into a list of elements that I then listed on new lines after every element. These skills such as Length and indexing will be helpful when editing strings and lists in the future. These techniques can, for example, be used when transferring data from a certain document into a vertical list.

## Assignment 14

In this assignment, I had to create two programs that edited arrays that used the information from a file. Both of the programs that I created took grades from a .txt file that held information formatted as name, grade. The two of the programs were essentially the same except the second one was made so that it would call out errors instead of just failing. This is going to be helpful in the future for when I need to read files and change them based on what I need at that time. I can also use the troubleshooting techniques that I learned/made in the future.
