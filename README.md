# CIS106-Avi-Schmookler

## Assignment 1

Hello World, My name is Avi Schmookler, I have joined the Cis 106 class because my goal is to either be in the data science field or the video game programming field. I used to program in Python frequently and I have taken a class on Swift. However, I have forgotten everything I did back then, ergo, I need to remind myself of how to code. I know the basics such as how to code in logic and I know some names and techniques for coding. I also am very good with math and thinking logically about problems. I am very excited for this class.

## Assignment 2

I selected Python 3 (Python) as my language, I have used it a bit before this so I have a small understanding of how it works. I intend to extend my knowledge on it and use it in a future job as a Data Scientist. I want to use it as well to make an easy to use D&D program for actions and such. I tried out GDB and Thonny but I think I am going to use GDB because it seems a bit more user friendly and it likes copy paste a bit more.
