# CIS106-Avi-Schmookler

## Assignment 1

Hello World, My name is Avi Schmookler, I have joined the Cis 106 class because my goal is to either be in the data science field or the video game programming field. I used to program in Python frequently and I have taken a class on Swift. However, I have forgotten everything I did back then, ergo, I need to remind myself of how to code. I know the basics such as how to code in logic and I know some names and techniques for coding. I also am very good with math and thinking logically about problems. I am very excited for this class.

## Assignment 2

I selected Python 3 (Python) as my language, I have used it a bit before this so I have a small understanding of how it works. I intend to extend my knowledge on it and use it in a future job as a Data Scientist. I want to use it as well, to make an easy to use D&D program for actions and such. I plan on doing that later tnight. I tried out GDB and Thonny but I think I am going to use GDB because it seems a bit more user friendly and it likes copy paste a bit more.

## Assignment 3

To be honest I didn't learn much if anything from this assignment considering the fact that I have gone far ahead on Flowgorithm so that I could create my code for personal use. However, the concept of this project is very useful because it teaches about inputs and how to use what one inputs in different ways. The project that I did, project 2, I felt was a very fun, simple project. I also did Activity 1 because it seemed useful. I plan on using this to allow inputs while editing information for Data Science projects to show possibilities of outcomes. This project was a very good introduction into the next week.

## Assignment 4

This assignment was extremely fun to do, I finially got to start to code again and it felt amazing being able to type out simple code again. This feeling is my favorite thing in the world. I did activity 3 and four for assignment 4 it was pretty simple to do and dodn't take much time, however, the inport of pi was slightly confusing considering that google wanted me to use the term insert so it was a bit confusing. I was able to use Flogorithm to remember the basics of print and insert and such however, while doing activity 4 I dodn't use it much if at all.

## Assignment 5

This assignment was interesting, it felt as if I was doing earlier projects, the activities wern't super challenging, I did activities five and seven, five was the one where I had to make a program where it calculates the area of a room where the length and the width are given as inputs. The second activity that I did, activity seven, required me to create a program where I asked for the name of the user's dog and ask for the age of the user's dog. My program then multiplys the age of the user's dog by seven and then gives the age of the user's dog in dog years. It was an interesting project.
